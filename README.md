   git clone https://github.com/omkardongre/socialhub.git
   cd socialhub
   ```

2. Start backend services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Run frontend separately:
   ```bash
   cd apps/frontend-nextjs
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run-migrations.sh
   ```

5. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - API Gateway: http://localhost:8082
   - RabbitMQ Dashboard: http://localhost:15672 (guest/guest)
   - Adminer (DB GUI): http://localhost:8080

## 📦 Production Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Configure AWS credentials
- GitHub Packages access (GHCR_TOKEN)

### Deployment Steps
1. Build and push Docker images:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build-and-push-ghcr.sh
   ```

2. Update environment files:
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure/env-files
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

3. Deploy infrastructure:
   ```bash
   cd ../
   terraform apply \
     -var="ghcr_username=your_username" \
     -var="ghcr_pat=your_github_pat" \
     -var="db_username=postgres" \
     -var="db_password=your_db_password"
   ```

4. Configure HTTPS reverse proxy:
   Follow the steps in [API HTTPS Setup Guide](./docs/api-https-setup.md)

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests
For each service, navigate to its directory and run:
```bash
# Unit tests with coverage
npm run test:unit

# End-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e

# Test coverage report
npm run test:cov
```

Example for auth service:
```bash
cd apps/auth-service
npm run test:unit
```
